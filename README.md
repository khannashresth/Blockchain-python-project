# Blockchain Python Project

A decentralized blockchain application built with Python. This project simulates a peer-to-peer network where nodes can create transactions, mine blocks, and interact with other peers to validate and propagate transactions and blocks.

## Features
- Peer-to-peer network with dynamic participant addition.
- Transaction creation and broadcasting.
- Block mining with proof-of-work (difficulty setting).
- Simple blockchain with transaction records.
- Tkinter-based GUI to interact with the blockchain and node.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies
Ensure that you have Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended). Then, install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, you can generate one by running:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
To run the app, simply execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will start the GUI where you can interact with the blockchain network, create transactions, mine blocks, and connect to other peers.

4. Running Multiple Nodes
To simulate multiple nodes, you can start multiple instances of the app with different port numbers by changing the node_port parameter. For example, to run a second node, set node_port=5001 when initializing the second instance.

Usage
Create a Participant: Add participants to the blockchain by entering a name in the "Add Participant" section and clicking the "Add Participant" button.
Create a Transaction: Generate a random transaction with the "Create Transaction" button. The transaction is added to the buffer.
Mine a Block: Use the "Mine Block" button to mine a block from the transaction buffer. The block will be added to the blockchain.
Send a Transaction: Broadcast the transaction to other connected peers using the "Send Transaction" button.
View Blockchain: Use the "Show Blockchain" button to see the entire blockchain.
Architecture
This blockchain application follows a basic structure:

BlockchainApp: The main GUI application that allows users to interact with the blockchain.
Node: A representation of a node in the blockchain network, which includes methods for handling transactions, mining blocks, and communicating with other peers.
Transaction & Block Creation: Helper functions to create transactions and blocks with necessary details like sender, receiver, amount, and hash.
P2P Network: Nodes communicate through a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) network where transactions and blocks are broadcasted to connected peers.
GUI: A Tkinter-based graphical user interface for a user-friendly interaction with the blockchain system.
Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to implement the blockchain.
Tkinter: Used for the GUI to allow interaction with the blockchain.
Socket Programming: To enable peer-to-peer communication between nodes.

Project Description
The Blockchain Python Project is a decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain application built with Python. It simulates a basic blockchain network where nodes can create transactions, mine blocks, and interact with other peers to validate and propagate blocks across the network. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily interact with the blockchain.

This project showcases the key elements of a blockchain system, including:

Transaction creation: Users can create random transactions with predefined senders, receivers, and amounts.
Block mining: The app mines blocks using a basic proof-of-work mechanism, with configurable difficulty and block size limits.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) network: Nodes communicate with each other to share transactions and blocks, ensuring that the blockchain remains synchronized across all nodes.
Blockchain management: The blockchain stores a list of blocks, each containing a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block's hash, making it tamper-proof and immutable.
This project is ideal for anyone interested in learning about the basics of blockchain technology, decentralized systems, and peer-to-peer networks, and serves as an excellent starting point for more advanced blockchain development.
